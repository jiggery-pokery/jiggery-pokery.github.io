      p Best World specialises in the development and distribution of health and beauty products in 12 markets, including China, Dubai, and Taiwan. As a direct selling company, Best World is very much rooted in the people. Warmth, familiarity, and a sense of kinship. Much like a community.
      p As Best World is listed on the Singapore Exchange, the website serves as a portal in providing relevant information to all stakeholders.
      p Corporate and financial information can be quite “dry” at times, so my aim was to keep the experience fresh, and the careful use of typography to help break the monotony.

      p I used photographs to convey a sense of openess and attention-to-detail; they also help provide relevant context to the content on the page.
      p As Best World is a company very much rooted by <i>the people</i>, the colours were graded to be warm and rich.
